# ALS Research Clustering Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on clustering analysis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patient data. The goal is to identify potential subgroups or progression patterns within the dataset, which could offer valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches and further research into this complex neurodegenerative disease.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Initial data exploration and cleaning will focus on relevant clinical and demographic variables.
- **Data Standardization**: Standardize the data to ensure the uniform contribution of features to the clustering algorithms.
- **Optimal Cluster Identification**: Using K-Means clustering to identify distinct patient subgroups and determine the optimal number of clusters with silhouette scores.
- **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization**: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize clustering results in two dimensions.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes anonymized clinical and demographic data of ALS patients from reliable sources.

## Usage

This project is intended for research purposes to explore ALS subtypes or progression patterns. Researchers and data scientists are encouraged to build upon this analysis.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please fork the repository and create a pull request.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
